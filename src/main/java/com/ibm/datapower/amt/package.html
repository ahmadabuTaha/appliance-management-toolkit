This package contains classes that are used by the <code>clientAPI</code> and <code>amp</code> packages. 
This package also serves as the topmost package in the hierarchy; all other packages
and classes for the IBM Appliance Management Toolkit are inside this namespace.

<h3><a name="logging">Logging</a></h3>

The manager uses JSR47 logging. When running standalone (i.e., JUnit), the logging
properties may be adjusted by using a mechanism such as specifying
<code>-Djava.util.logging.config.file=myLogging.properties</code> when invoking
the Java runtime (JRE). 
<p />
When the manager is packaged with a client, the mechanism 
for adjusting the logging properties will depend
on which client is calling the clientAPI. 
<p>
The manager uses chained loggers. This is because each class has its own logger
and the name of each log is the fully-qualified class name (including the package).
So for example, you can affect the logger with any of the following names:
<ul>
<li>com.ibm.datapower.amt</li>
<li>com.ibm.datapower.amt.amp</li>
<li>com.ibm.datapower.amt.defaultProvider</li>
<li>com.ibm.datapower.amt.defaultProvider.CommandsImpl</li>
</ul>

All of the loggers also belong the group defined in
<a href="clientAPI/Manager.html#getLoggerGroupName()"><code>clientAPI.Manager.getLoggerGroupName()</code></a>.
So you can also affect the loggers via that group name.
Generally <code>FINE</code>
or <code>FINER</code> should be sufficient to see the program flow. Using
<code>FINEST</code> will give the greatest amount of detail.
