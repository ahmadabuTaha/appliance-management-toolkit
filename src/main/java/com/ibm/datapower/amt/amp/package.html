The Appliance Management Protocol (AMP) provides an abstraction layer for
message and command communication between the Manager and the
DataPower devices. It provides a Java interface so that the caller does
not need to know the format of the messages or the transport mechanism
used to communicate with the device. Because this is a Java interface,
a specific implementation of this interface needs to be provided
for actual communication with DataPower devices. 
<p />
WAMT provides default implementations for AMP in the
<code>com.ibm.datapower.amt.amp.defaultProvider</code> and 
<code>com.ibm.datapower.amt.amp.defaultV2Provider</code> packages.
<p />
AMP may also be referred to as "HLM", which is an abbreviation for
"High Level Management". HLM is meant to contrast with SOMA, which is
a low-level management. HLM was the initial name for AMP, it may not
have been changed in all places.

To start using AMP, refer to:
