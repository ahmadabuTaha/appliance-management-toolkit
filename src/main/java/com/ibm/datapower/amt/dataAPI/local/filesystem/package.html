<h3>Local File System Implementation of the dataAPI Interface for the IBM Appliance Management Toolkit</h3>
<p>The local file system (LFS) implementation of the dataAPI persists relevant information in the local file system. It transforms the 
persistable objects defined by the dataAPI into XMLobjects before writing them to an XML file. Internally, the implementation uses XML Beans 
technology for accessing the XML by binding it to Java types. XMLBeans uses an XML Schema, in the LFS implementation, to 
compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data.  Firmware and domain configuration images are
stored as BIN files.  You can examine the WAMT.repository.xml file to see how the various elements can stand in relation to each other. There is an
element that represents each stored object defined in the dataAPI.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Configuration of the Local File System base directory</h4>
   When the Manager is initialized, it attempts to locate a repository directory configured on the Credential
   object.  See {@link com.ibm.datapower.amt.Credential} on how to set Credential properties. If one is not provided,
   it next attempts to locate the configured repository directory using 
   the value in the <code>WAMT_REPOS_HOME</code> environment variable.
   This is the directory where the WAMT.repository.xml file is stored.
   The WAMT.repository.xml file contains all of the Manager's configuration meta-data.    
   Configuration artifacts such as a domain configuration backups and device firmares are also stored under the directory.
   During manager initialization, if the specified directory does not exist, a new directory is created.
</p><p>
   If <code>WAMT_REPOS_HOME</code> environment variable is not specified, the configured repository directory is
   resolved by using the path specified by the <code>user.home</code> property.  This directory is automatically created 
   if it does not already exist.
</p><p>
   If the Manager locates an existing WAMT.repository.xml file, it loads data into the stored objects.  
   If the Manager does not find WAMT.repository.xml file, it will start up without any data and prepare to write
   to a new file.
</p>
<p><h4>Manager shutdown events</h4>
When the Manager shutdowns gracefully, it will close down the repository and write all current
data into the repository XML file.  It will also clean up any obsolete bin files from the directory. For example, a bin file can
become obsolete if the firmware version that referenced the file is deleted. 
</p>
<p><h4>Saving configuration changes</h4>
 The clientAPI saves data as it is modified. The Manager saves a backup copy of the repository file before it saves the current data. The backup
 copy is overwritten before each save.</p>
 <p><h4>Local File System use of the Credential object</h4>
 The LFS implementation only uses the following properties from the Crendential object passed to
 it by the Manager:
 <ul>
 <li><code>RepositoryEncryptionPassword</code> - the password used for encrypting sensitive information that is persisted to the repository.   
 For example, it is used to encrypt persisted user passwords. 
 If not provided, LFS will use a static default value.  It is recommended that you provide 
 this password for additional security.</li>
 <li><code>RepositoryDirectory</code> - the directory where the repository XML file will be saved.
 If not provided, LFS will look for the a value in the <code>WAMT_REPOS_HOME</code> environment variable. If the
<code>WAMT_REPOS_HOME</code> environment variable is not set, it will attempt tp use the path specified by the <code>user.home</code> property.
 </ul>
 The Credential is passed to the Manager during initialization.  
 <ul>
 See {@link com.ibm.datapower.amt.clientAPI.Manager#OPTION_CREDENTIAL} for the Manager Credential option.
 See {@link com.ibm.datapower.amt.Credential} on how to set Credential properties.
 </ul>
